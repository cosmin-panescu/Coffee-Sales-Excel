# Coffee-Sales-Excel
ðŸ“Œ Excel Raport Project

This is an Excel project where I first collected the data, processed it, and then used pivot tables and pivot charts to build a dynamic interactive dashboard for coffee sales. 

To reach the final result, I used the following functions from Excel:
- XLOOKUP
- INDEX MATCH
- Data cleaning
- Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
- Timeline and Slicers
- Date and Number Formating
- Basic Formulas
